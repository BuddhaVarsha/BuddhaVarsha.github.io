      <p>The full meaning of iOS takes a bit more explanation. When the iPhone was introduced in 2007, its operating system was originally called "iPhone OS." Despite the name, the iPod Touch (which launched later in 2007) also ran iPhone OS. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad, which ran the same OS.
